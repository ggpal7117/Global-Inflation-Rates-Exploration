# Global-Inflation-Rates-Exploration
In the exploratory data analysis, we look at Consumer Price Indexes(CPI) data from around the world. The data was provided by the World Bank, and it shows the CPI of every country for that particular year. 
**NOTE**: Some countries have more data than others. 

# What is CPI and Inflation
CPI and Inflation are two terms that are thrown around and often are used interchangeably. However, they are two different things. CPI is an essential factor for determining inflation rates, but is more specifically defined as the level of prices of goods and services commonly bought by households. Countries with higher CPIs may have to pay more for key goods and services, whereas countries with lower CPIs pay less. 
Inflation, on the other hand, is defined as the rate at which goods and services increase. It can be calculated by taking the percent change of the CPI for that country.
In this project, we looked at trends regarding both metrics for countries around the world.

# United States CPI and Inflation
The first part of the project was looking at these two key economic measures for the US. The CPI from the 1960s to the early 1970s was fairly low at just below 20, and stayed very flat and consistent. However, after that, we see an exponential increase in the CPI year-over-year. In the graph showing the US inflation rates, we see that the US reached nearly 14% inflation in 1980. There are many as for why this is such as bad weather conditions driving food costs up, oil embargos driving energy up, and price controls. However, the main reason was monetary policy decisions, where the Federal Reserve was hesitant to cut interest rates and also increase the money supply. Inflation rates eventually leveled put, averaging 4% change(increase) per year. 

# Countries with Highest and Lowest Inflation Rates 1960-2014
For this part of the project, we looked at countries with the highest and lowest MEDIAN inflation rates to see which countries generally had higher and lower changes(increases) in prices. The countries with the highest inflation during this time were Turkey, Colombia, and Uruguay, and the countries that experienced lower inflation were Switzerland, Panama, and Singapore.
Turkey has printed money due to fiscal deficits, as has Colombia in the past. Also, the many conflicts and civil wars in Colombia have caused prices to soar. Uruguay's inflation stems from the country's national debt. Generally, these countries are more prone to political instability, resulting in higher costs.
On the other hand, Singapore, Switzerland, and Panama are more politically stable. Also, Panama uses the US dollar, so inflation is closely related to that of the US. Switzerland has a strong central bank, and Singapore's strong export economy kept prices stable during those times.

# Countries with Highest and Lowest CPI
In the "cpi.png" file, you can find the plotly visualization of countries with the highest and lowest CPI(the highest price basket for basic goods and services). In the file, you'll also see year-over-year changes in CPI in Venezuela(the country with the highest average CPI) and the Democratic Republic of Congo(the country with the highest average CPI). Venezuela's hyperinflation stems from corruption, a tragic government, and economic mismanagement. Since Venezuela's economy is dependent on oil, as they have the largest oil reserves, when oil prices dropped, there was less money in Venezuela. So, the government decided to print more money, which has caused inflation to skyrocket and the currency to be worth next to nothing.
Congo, on the other hand,d has a very low CPI, which may seem like a good thing, but isn't necessarily. CPI reflects prices, not the strength of the economy. In reality, Congo is one of the poorest countries in the world, and prices are most likely low due to poverty and underdeveloped markets. Also, Congo experienced a large surge of inflation right before the 2000s due to the wars in the region.

# Boxplots
The project finished by showing boxplot distributions of countries with high and low inflation rates and CPIs.

# Conclusion
This project aimed to provide insights about which countries experience high and low inflation rates, aswell as looking at countries ' CPIs to determine the health of certain countries' economies. Inflation is very important to keep under control so people can buy simple goods and services. Thank you for your time.
